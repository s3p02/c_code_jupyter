# SHELL COMMANDS & C CODE USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
This is a tutorial to write, save and run c code using jupyter notebook. I will demonstrate a simple Hello World! c program. I will also discuss a few shell commands, that can be run using jupyter notebooks.

I have prepared this on a mac. You are required to install Anaconda Python for using jupyter notebook, which is available for [macOS, Windows and Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). You are also required to have a gcc compiler.

Here's how to install Anaconda Python 2.7 on [Linux](https://github.com/s3p02/gcp_install_anaconda_python) from the terminal.

Once installed, run:


```
jupyter notebook
```

Will update on how to install & run on Windows & macOS soon.
